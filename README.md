# Metal-Hardways

A repository for experimenting with Metal rendering experiments and demos for educational purposes.

## Overview
This repository contains various Metal rendering experiments implemented from scratch. The goal is to understand low-level graphics programming concepts by implementing them using Apple's Metal framework.

## Current Demos

### 1. Pixel Lighting
A 2D lighting system that demonstrates:
- Real-time dynamic lighting
- Light source controlled by touch input
- Shadow casting from obstacles
- Light attenuation and falloff
- Smooth lighting transitions

### 2. Parallax Scrolling
A parallax scrolling effect that features:
- Multiple scrolling layers
- Different scroll speeds per layer
- Texture sampling and blending
- Smooth infinite scrolling
- Audio Support during scrolling
